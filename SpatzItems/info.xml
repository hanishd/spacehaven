Version: 1.0
  
Adds several new items to the game, and overhauls some existing ones.

> Light (floor lamp) now uses 1 Soft Block instead of 1 Infra Block.  Its light radius is increased from 6 to 8 tiles.

> Vent requires 100 Tools, not 1 Infra Block.  (Doors include a vent, so a vent shouldn't cost nearly as much as a door.)

> Added Hats and Sunglasses.  Both are headgear items; Hats are made at the Micro-Weaver (cost 1 Fabric), Sunglasses at the Item Fabricator (cost 1 Steel Plates).

> Added new recreational facility: TV.  Wall-mounted, weak light source that adds a large comfort to the nearby area; costs 1 Tech Block.  Compared to the Jukebox or Arcade Machine, the TV produces adds more Comfort (and produces light) but in a smaller area, and it must be mounted on a wall.
