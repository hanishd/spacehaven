Mods for the beta of Space Haven, by Spatzimaus

This repository consists of four distinct mods:

# Crazy Spatz's Foods
	Adds four new crops to the game:
		Soylent: creates Fertilizer, consumes Bio-Matter
		Cactus: creates Water
		Brussels Sprouts: emergency food; grows very quickly, but poisonous
		Tiberium: creates Energium and Chemicals, but produces hazardous gases as it grows.
	Based on the "More Foods" mod by Tron762 (https://github.com/Tron762/SpaceHavenMods)

# Crazy Spatz's Items
  (Not functional yet)
	Modifies costs several furniture items for better game balance, replacing the default cost (1 Infra Block, 10 Tools) with more appropriate values.
	Adds several new furniture items.
	Adds several new personal inventory items to the game, and modifies some existing ones.
	
	NOTE: The balance parts of this mod function at present, but clicking on one of the new inventory items in the Micro-Weaver will crash your game.  As this will send a crash report to the developers, please don't do this for now.

# Crazy Spatz's Refining
	Overhauls the entire industrial design of this game by creating two parallel lines of refining:
		"Active" processing (most of the vanilla game) is fast but energy-intensive, and requires a user.
		"Passive" processing is very slow, similar to the Composter, with corresponding decreases in energy, heat, and gas costs.  Crewmen are only needed for Logistics.
	More facilities now have multiple processes, giving players flexibility in their industrial setups.  This required some shuffling of processes, and several facilities were renamed.
	Some crafting recipes were also changed to be less of a straight 1:1 conversion between resources; most processes now have multiple inputs, multiple outputs, or both.

# Crazy Spatz's Recycling
	The Recycler is now a slow "passive" refinery, converting scrap to usable blocks over time.
	The recipes for scrap conversion have also been changed to produce fewer blocks but some intermediate ingredients to make more replacement blocks at an Assembler.
	Adds a recipe for recycling Rubble.

Each mod must be placed in your /mods/ folder to function.
